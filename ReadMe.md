# Dockerfiles
## Robert Haines

Various Dockerfiles for images that I create.

### Usage

The pre-built images are available, if appropriate, on the [docker hub](https://hub.docker.com/u/hainesr/).

Each image contained in this repository has a command for running it in the Dockerfile comments.

### Building

In general you just need to build these images in the usual way:

```
$ docker build -t <tag> <build-dir>
```

If a particular image requires any special steps these will be detailed below.

### Licence

BSD. See LICENCE for details.
